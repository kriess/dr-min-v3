      text: 'You did a breast lift on me at about 2 years ago. I just wanted to let you know that when I went for my yearly mammography the technician said, and I quote  "I see a lot of breasts  and that is the best breast lift I have seen";....... Needless to say that  made me very happy and I owe it to you!!!   Thanks again.',

For years I  have relied on Botox and all the other great products available  --- but there comes a point when they can only do so  much. I am a very happy and grateful patient of  yours. Again – Thank you.',

      text: "I have had so many compliments on  my face and most people think I lost weight and look great. I tell them I  had plastic surgery with the most incredible surgeon on the planet. My  own internist still is amazed by your work and I joke and tell him it's all in  her tailor's degree!! My face looks so young for an old lady!  But the youthful part is also psychological as I feel so much better about  myself! I don't hide in pictures anymore. And have been doing a lot  more socially. You have given me so much happiness and I cannot believe  how quickly I recovered. That was such a worry beforehand and I believe  it was your expertise that led to such a fast and healthy recovery. All  of my family and friends witnessed it.",

      text: "Dr. Min performed  a full facelift and upper and lower eyelid surgery as well as a brow lift on my  face. This was the second time that I had  this surgery (a previous one was done  many years prior by a different Plastic Surgeon). Dr. Min's surgery produced a  very natural and soft look. Her kind, gentle  and understanding demeanor is incomparable. Dr. Min's concern for her patients  and availability to help at all times are unmatched. Based on my comparison between the various  plastic surgeries and plastic surgeons that I have had over the years, I feel  that Dr. Min is a superb plastic surgeon and I would highly recommend her for  any plastic surgery!",

Knowing  exactly what will actually work is difficult to assess; especially when one  doesn't want to resemble a &quot;wax-work&quot;. Dr Min's suggestions were reasonable, doable  and she had the talent and expertise to carry them out. I am very pleased with my results. I am only sorry that she has changed coasts  and is no longer available cross-town for future improvements!",

      text: "Dr. Caroline Min made me feel  extremely comfortable throughout my surgical procedure. Our initial consultation went so well that I  immediately knew she was the doctor I wanted to trust with my body. I'd previously consulted other doctors but  Dr. Min treated me with such care and listened carefully to my fears and  questions. Her positive attitude and  amazing bedside manner is unlike any other doctor I've encountered in Los Angeles. She took  care of me as if I were family. I am so  grateful to her and her amazing staff.  She has granted me the greatest gift and yet she is so humble about her  precision as a surgeon and healthcare giver.  She rocks!!! Thanks for making me  feel beautiful!",

      text: "It took me about two and a half  years to lose over 100 lbs. Diet and  exercise works well. But all the  exercise in the world was not going to make the skin hanging from my arms  disappear. Brachioplasty, however,  would. I also needed liposuction on my  upper back. Surgery was not a rash, nor  easy decision. Albeit elective, this  was, nonetheless, surgery. I had several  consultations. Then, at the suggestion  of a close friend who had a different procedure done with Dr. Caroline Min, I  had the privilege of meeting this wonderful doctor. My consultation with Dr. Min put  me immediately at ease. Her calm and  supportive demeanor almost belies her expertise. She spoke “with” me, not “at” me, about  realistic expectations. I walked away  from the consultation knowing full well what the procedures entailed, the  recovery involved, and the results to be expected. I walked away with a feeling of her total  competence coupled with compassion. Dr.  Min is special. It is now four months since my  surgery. I have physician friends who  viewed Dr. Min's “handiwork” and said just how good it looks. More importantly, I know how good I  look. I am a different person. For the first time in my life, my arms look  “normal”. My bank account suffers  because of all the sleeveless clothing I have bought to show off my new arms. I  know that I will look even better as those amazingly straight pencil lines of  scars diminish with time. I don't think  she can truly appreciate how she has changed my life. I am deeply grateful.",

I love the way they  feel and everyone tells me my breasts look so real.   My  breasts now have a natural drop and move according to any body movement I  make but the great thing is they don't look saggy. They look full  and pretty much awesome if I do say so myself. I want to thank you again  for the great job you performed. ",

      text: 'After losing over 40 lbs. due to a  stressful personal life, two C-sections and breastfeeding two children, I was  left with excessive skin and was in desperate need of a tummy tuck and breast  lift, at the age of 36. I had been researching plastic surgeons for the last 5  years. Being a cautious person, I could not find one that made me feel  comfortable and confident with their work and my outcome. After three different  consultations, I gave up hope. Then, I met Dr. Caroline Min. Not only did I feel an immediate level of comfort  but her expertise as a surgeon was very impressive. Her general surgery  background combined with her experience as a plastic surgeon was exactly what I  was looking for. The concern that she showed while educating me on precisely  what needed to be accomplished to get satisfactory results put me at ease. She  gave me special attention and really took her time with me.  Dr. Min was always there to  personally answer any questions that I had prior, during and after my surgery.  I could not have imagined that my body would have looked this great. She took her  time in determining the best way to perform the surgeries to minimize scarring  and her delicate hands left me with minimal scars. I have a flat stomach from  the tummy tuck and a lollipop lift with fading scars and small saline implants,  which was the only way to go to achieve successful results for my breasts. She  is truly an artist of the human body, I call her my angel. Looking at my body  prior to surgery brought me to tears of sadness, but now I look like I never  even had any surgery, so natural looking....an awesome body!!!  Thank you Dr. Min, you gave me a  NEW BODY for life!!!!!  You are amazing at what you do and  the world is lucky to have you!',
